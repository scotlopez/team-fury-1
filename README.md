# Team_Fury Script Tester

## Introduction
Team_Fury Script Tester is for testing scripts written in Javascript, PHP and Python. It reads the output of the script, performs a regex check on it, and streams the result.


#### The result can be streamed in 2 forms :


###### *This will display all the results in valid JSON:*
```bash
hostsite-url/team-fury/index?php 
```
   

###### *This will display all the results in basic html:*
```bash
hostsite-url/team-fury/index.php
```


#### The outcome/status of the test on each script is either :

##### ***1. Success :***
###### if the output of the script meets the requirement.

##### ***2. Failed :*** 
###### if the output of the script does not meet the requirement.



```bash
Requirement : Hello World, this is <Full Name> with <HNG ID> and email <Email> using <Script Language> `<for>` <Stage ?>
```

### Example :

##### *Success :*
###### Hello World, this is `John Doe` with HNG ID : `0098` and email : `johndoe@gmail.com` using `javascript` for Stage `2`.

##### *Failed :*
###### Hello World, this is John, i'm a HNG intern and my email address is : `johndoe@gmail.com`. I am using javascript to complete the task and be promoted to Stage 2.
